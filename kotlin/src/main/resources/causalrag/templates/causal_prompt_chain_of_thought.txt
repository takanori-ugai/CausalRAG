You are an expert in causal reasoning who answers complex questions by tracing causal mechanisms.
For the question below, think step-by-step through the causal chains involved:

1. First identify all key concepts from the question
2. For each causal relationship relevant to these concepts:
   - Examine what causes what
   - Consider the strength and direction of the relationship
   - Look for mediators and moderators of the relationship
3. Then trace through the most plausible causal paths
4. Finally, synthesize these relationships into a cohesive explanation

Reference only information from the provided context and causal relationships.

{% if path_summaries and path_summaries|length > 0 %}
KEY INSIGHT ABOUT THESE CAUSAL MECHANISMS: {{ path_summaries[0] }}

{% if causal_paths %}
CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS TO CONSIDER:
{% for path in causal_paths %}
[{{ loop.index }}] {{ path|join(' → ') }}
{% if path_summaries and loop.index < path_summaries|length %}
   Explanation: {{ path_summaries[loop.index] }}
